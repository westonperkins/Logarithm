2^3 = 8
    - 2 to the power of 3 is 8

log(8) = 3

log(x) = y 
if and only if
2^y = x

the number 2 is implied as the base when log is being used
    - i.e: log(8) is equivalent to saying log(base)2(exponent)8

as X doubles, Y increases by 1: log(x) = Y

log(8) = 3
log(16) = 4
log(32) = 5
log(64) = 6
log(128) = 7

as Y increases by 1, X doubles

HOW THIS APPLIES TO ALOGRITHMS

Linear time: an alogrithm that runs in linear time to complete, for example, an algorithm that, as the input value increases, the time the alogrithm takes to complete increaes linearly
    - for example: an alogrithm that traverses a list of numbers
    - i.e a list of 8 numbers will take 8 operations to complete, 16 numbers will take 16 operations to complete

Logarithmic time: an alogrithm that runs in logarithmic time to complete, as the input size increases, the time it takes to complete increases logarimically
    - if the input size is 128 and the alogrithm runs in logarithmic time, the alogrithm will take 7 steps to complete. Where as a linear time alogrithm will take 128 steps to complete
